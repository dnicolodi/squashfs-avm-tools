This document summarizes all (so far known) technical details about
the non-standard SquashFS format (called AVM-BE below) used by AVM
since Fritz!OS release 6.35.

 - AVM-BE format is a SquashFS4 based SquashFS format

 - it uses big-endian layout for most of the data stored in the
   SquashFS image (to be more precise for all file system related
   data) instead of the little-endian data layout used by the
   original/unmodified code since SquashFS4

 - the only data field stored in the little-endian format is the block
   length value at the beginning of each block

 - compression method is hardcoded to be XZ (aka LZMA2)

 - it is unknown if any compressor specific option could be set: all
   original AVM images seen so far have COMP_OPT flag unset

 - super-block field 'mkfs_time' contains the same value as the
   super-block field 'bytes_used' instead of the filesystem creation
   time

 - user id table is always stored uncompressed [1]

Support for the AVM-BE SquashFS format is maintained by the Freetz
developers based on initial implementation by the IPPF user PeterPawn.

[1] This aspect needs more investigation. The current implementation
    assumes that it always gets stored uncompressed. However, this
    behavior might also be achieved by the original/unmodified code
    just because the size of the compressed data would be bigger than
    the size of the uncompressed one.
