This repository exists to provide an easy way to obtain the
unsquashfs4-avm-be tool required to unpack AVM Fritz!OS firmware
images (for example to extract hardware firmware blobs).

Since release 6.35 AVM Fritz!OS uses a non-standard SquashFS format
based on SquashFS4 (called AVM-BE here, see README-AVM-BE for
details). The Freetz https://freetz.org distribution contains
mksquashfs and unsquashfs tools supporting this format. Downloading
the whole distribution and compiling the required dependencies just to
get these tools is not however very practical. Thus this project.

The support for AVM-BE format is distributed in Freetz in the form of
a set of patches over squashfs-tools release 4.3 tarball. These
patches can be obtaned from here:

https://github.com/Freetz/freetz/tree/master/tools/make/squashfs4-host-be/patches 

This repository is a clone of the squashfs-tools repository

https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-tools

with the relevant patches applied on top. Patches relevant only for
the Freetz distribution have been omitted. The patches have been
transformed in git commits maintaining authorship as determined by the
commits in the Freetz git repository that introduced them. Commit
messages have also been derived from patch file names and commit
messages.
